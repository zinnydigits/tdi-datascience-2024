# TDI - NumPy Data Science Assignment
This assignment is designed to introduce you to the fundamental concepts and functionalities of NumPy, a powerful library for data analysis and scientific computing in Python.

The assignment is divided into two sections: Basic and Advanced. 
Each section contains questions that will test your understanding of different NumPy operations.

Note: install numpy library using `pip install numpy --upgrade`

## Section 1: Basic Questions
**1. NumPy Array Creation and Manipulation**

a)	Create a 1D array of numbers from 1 to 10.

b)	Reshape the array into a 2x5 matrix.

c)	Find the element located in the second row, third column of the matrix.

**2. Basic Array Operations**

a)	Create two NumPy arrays: array_1 = [10, 20, 30] and array_2 = [1, 2, 3].

b)	Perform element-wise addition, subtraction, and multiplication of these arrays.

c)	Calculate the sum, mean, and standard deviation of the resulting array after element-wise multiplication.

**3. Broadcasting and Reshaping**

a)	Create a 1D array of numbers from 0 to 15. Reshape it into a 3x5 matrix.

b)	Add 10 to each element in the matrix using broadcasting.

c)	Create another 3x5 matrix and multiply the two matrices using broadcasting.

**4. Logical Operations and Boolean Indexing**

a)	Create an array with values: [15, 22, 33, 41, 50, 65, 72].

b)	Use boolean indexing to filter out values that are greater than 40.

c)	Replace all values greater than 40 with the value 0 in the original array.

## Section 2: Advanced Questions
**1. Matrix Operations**

a)	Create a 3x3 matrix using the values [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]].

b)	Find the transpose of the matrix.

c)	Perform matrix multiplication with another 3x3 matrix of your choice using np.dot().

d)	Calculate the inverse of the resulting matrix, if possible.

**2. Statistical Analysis**

a)	Create two arrays: array_x = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9] and array_y = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10].

b)	Compute the correlation coefficient between the two arrays using np.corrcoef().

c)	Generate 1000 random numbers from a normal distribution and find the 95th percentile.

**3. Solving Linear Equations**

a)	Solve the following system of equations using NumPy:

   2x + y = 10

   x - y = 2

   Use matrix form to solve this using np.linalg.solve().

**4. Fancy Indexing and Conditional Selection**

a)	Create an array: array = [25, 45, 15, 75, 35, 55, 85].

b)	Use fancy indexing to rearrange the elements in descending order.

c)	Use np.where() to replace all values greater than 50 with 100 and values less than or equal to 50 with 0.

**5. Performance Comparison: NumPy vs. Python Lists**

a)	Create a Python list with 1 million elements and a NumPy array with the same number of elements.

b)	Write a Python function that computes the sum of all elements in both the list and the NumPy array.

c)	Use the timeit module to compare the time taken to sum the elements in both the list and the NumPy array. Report the time difference.

## SUBMISSION MODE
You are expected to submit your assignment a week after it was given, with this, Submission starts from Friday 7am Nigerian time to Saturday 3pm Nigerian time.
