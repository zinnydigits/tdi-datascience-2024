## Developing Interactive Python Games for Educational Purposes

You’ve recently joined an educational tech company as a junior Data Scientist. Your manager has tasked you with creating two interactive Python games to help students understand basic programming concepts. You will develop a Rock Paper Scissors game and a Number Guessing game. This assignment will assess your proficiency with Python basics, functions, and modules.

### Task Overview:
Your objective is to use Python to develop these two games while demonstrating your understanding of variables, data types, operators and control structures. This assignment is crucial for showcasing your coding skills and contributing to educational content.

To aid in your development, your manager has provided a set of recommended online resources. These tutorials will help you refresh or learn essential Python concepts needed to complete this assignment:

 **Resource 1:** [Python for Beginners - Learn Python in 1 Hour](https://youtu.be/kqtD5dpn9C8?si=kDbO9Zm4nsENO86Y&t=330)
 
 **Resource 2:** [Learn Python in Less than 10 Minutes for Beginners (Fast & Easy)](https://youtu.be/fWjsdhR3z3c?si=Yp-TqrYl9U9eCzl5)

**Resource 3:** [Learn Python With One Project](https://youtu.be/th4OBktqK1I?si=jQMc12IaC8dX2FdQ)

**Resource 4:** https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/beginner-python/

## PART A: 
### Game Development Instructions

#### 1. Rock Paper Scissors Game:
    Objective: Create a Rock Paper Scissors game where the user plays against the computer.
**Instructions:**
1. Prompt the user to choose Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
2. The computer should randomly select one of these options.
3. Compare the user’s choice with the computer’s choice to determine the winner.
4. Display the result (win, lose, or draw).
5. After each round, ask the user if they want to play again. Continue until the user chooses to exit.

#### 2. Number Guessing Game:
    Objective: Develop a Number Guessing game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number.
**Instructions:**
1. Generate a random number between 1 and 20.
2. Allow the player up to 3 attempts to guess the number.
3. For each guess:
    If the guess is too high, prompt the player to guess a lower number.
    If the guess is too low, prompt the player to guess a higher number.
4. Display whether the player has won or lost after 3 attempts.
5. Ask the player if they want to play again and restart the game if they choose to continue.
