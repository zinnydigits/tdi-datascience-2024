## Week 1: Introduction to Data Science

This task provides an introduction to data science concepts and tools. This includes how data science differentiates from traditional data analysis, roles and responsibilities of a data scientist in a business environment, difference between supervised and unsupervised learning, popular tools and libraries used in data science and their key feature and lots more.

## Week 2: Rock Paper Scissors and Number Guessing Game
 
In this task, two simple Python games were developed to practice basic programming skills. The first game is a Rock-Paper-Scissors game where the user plays against the computer. The second game is a Number Guessing Game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number.

**Skills Covered:**
- Basic Python programming
- Control flow (if-else statements, loops)
- Random number generation

## Week 3: Employees Contact Book Application

This task involved creating a simple console-based application for managing employees' contact information. The application allows users to add employee records with unique `empID`, phone number, and email. The focus was on ensuring the uniqueness of each record and managing data integrity through basic Python operations.

**Skills Covered:**
- Lists, tuples, dictionaries, string manipulation, input validation, basic error handling and functions.

## Week 4: Employee Data Management and Analysis System

In this task, a JSON file containing employee data was analyzed without using any external Python libraries. The analysis required a strong understanding of working with lists, dictionaries, and grouping data within dictionaries. The task was designed to enhance problem-solving skills by managing and analyzing data purely with native Python data structures.

**Skills Covered:**
- JSON data handling
- Data analysis using native Python structures
- Lists and dictionaries

## Week 5: Data Structures and Objected Oriented Programming (OOP)
This task involves creating a Python-based system to manage and analyze employee data using core Python features like object-oriented programming, CSV handling, and data slicing without external libraries. A Class was developed for employees, inheritance implemented, and data manipulated based on various criteria such as salary and age.

**Skills Covered:**
- Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Data Manipulation in Python
- Data Structures
