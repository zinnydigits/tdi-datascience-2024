## TDI STRUCTURED QUERY LANGUAGE WEEK 3

Introduction

### Welcome to SQL week 3!

In this assignment, you will delve into the crucial concepts of SQL joins, which are essential for combining data from multiple tables based on related columns. Understanding how to use different types of joins using the primary keys and foreign keys will allows you to extract meaningful information from relational databases effectively. The joins you will explore include:

1. Inner Join: Returns records that have matching values in both tables.

2. Left Join (or Left Outer Join): Returns all records from the left table and the matched records from the right table. Unmatched records from the left table will still be shown with NULL values for columns from the right table.

3. Right Join (or Right Outer Join): Returns all records from the right table and the matched records from the left table. Unmatched records from the right table will still be shown with NULL values for columns from the left table.

4. Full Outer Join: Returns all records when there is a match in either the left or right table. Unmatched records from both tables will be included, with NULL values in place of missing matches.

By understanding and applying these join types, you will be able to perform complex queries that can combine and present data from multiple tables in various ways. This knowledge is fundamental for data analysis, reporting, and building comprehensive database queries.

During this assignment, you will work with a provided dataset. You will use this dataset to practice and demonstrate your ability to perform different types of joins. This will help solidify your understanding and provide practical experience in handling real-world data scenarios.

The questions are designed to guide you through the following practical applications:

1. Inner Join: Identifying records that have common attributes in both tables.

2. Left Join: Ensuring all records from the primary table are included in the result set, with appropriate matches from the secondary table.

3. Right Join: Ensuring all records from the secondary table are included in the result set, with appropriate matches from the primary table.

4. Full Outer Join: Combining all records from both tables, including those without matches in the other table.

By the end of this assignment, you will be proficient in using various join operations in SQL, enabling you to merge data effectively and derive insightful information from relational databases. Letâ€™s get started with the resources the answer the questions to enhance your SQL join capabilities!
